## Setup/Installation Requirements (install this repository on your machine)
* Copy the following link to your clipboard: https://github.com/sinkstyt/weekday-determiner.git
* Open a Bash Terminal (some might call it a 'command line')
* In this terminal window, navigate to a directory into which you will clone this project (make a local copy from the GitHub remote copy)

> at Terminal promt
```
users/YOUR_USERNAME/ $ git clone https://github.com/sinkstyt/weekday-determiner.git
```
* After the page has been cloned to your chosen directory, use `$ cd weekday-determiner` to switch into its root folder.
* Check to see that you have npm installed with the prompt `$ npm -v`. As long as the first number in the version is 3 or greater, you should not anticipate any problems. If you are using OS X or greater and npm is not installed, use the command `$ brew install node`
* Check node version with `$ node -v`. Node version should start with a 4 or higher.
* For Windows users without npm, go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the LTS (long term support) option most appropriate for your system
* From within the root directory, use the following commands to have npm (Node package manager) install other dependencies
> `$ npm install`

> `$ npm run start`
